## Description
A quality README allows users to understand the purpose of a project and also allows the creator a chance to showcase their application. The purpose of this project is to allow users to generate a quality README by providing answers to some prompts that will automatically fill out the contents of the README. This will save time on creating a README when creating future projects.
